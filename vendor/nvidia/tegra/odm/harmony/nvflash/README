Instructions for playing an audio clip in the bootloader

1. Any .wav file can be played during the bootloader. The .wav file needs to be copied to the folder where nvflash2 is present.
   The sample wav file that is flashed by default is located at <branches>\customers\nvidia\harmony\partition_data\wav\beep.wav

2. A new partition should be added to the .cfg file which should be of the following type:
        
        In case of emmc fused boards:
        
        [partition]
        name=WAV
        id=7
        type=data
        allocation_policy=sequential
        filesystem_type=basic
        size=17032 
        file_system_attribute=0
        filename=audio.wav
        allocation_attribute=0
        percent_reserved=0
        
        In case of nand fused boards:
        
        [partition]
        name=WAV
        id=6
        type=data
        allocation_policy=sequential
        filesystem_type=basic
        size=17032 
        file_system_attribute=0
        filename=audio.wav
        allocation_attribute=8
        percent_reserved=0
          
3. After flashing the device, you should be able to hear the audio after the splash screen comes up.
