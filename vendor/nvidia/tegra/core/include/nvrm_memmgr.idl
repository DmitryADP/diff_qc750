/**
 * FAQ for commonly asked questions:
 *
 * Q) Why can NvRmMemMap fail?
 * A) Some operating systems don't allow user mode applications to map arbitrary
 *    memory regions, this is a huge security hole.  In other environments, such
 *    as simulation, its just not even possible to get a direct pointer to 
 *    the memory, because the simulation is in a different process.
 *
 * Q) What do I do if NvRmMemMap fails?
 * A) Driver writers have two choices.  If the driver must have a mapping, for
 *    example direct draw requires a pointer to the memory then the driver
 *    will have to fail whatever operation it is doing and return an error.
 *    The other choice is to fall back to using NvRmMemRead/Write functions
 *    or NvRmMemRdxx/NvRmMemWrxx functions, which are guaranteed to succeed.
 *
 * Q) Why should I use NvRmMemMap instead of NvOsPhysicalMemMap?
 * A) NvRmMemMap will do a lot of extra work in an OS like WinCE to create
 *    a new mapping to the memory in your process space.  NvOsPhysicalMemMap
 *    will is for mapping registers and other non-memory locations.  Using
 *    this API on WindowsCE will cause WindowsCE to crash.
 *
 * Q) Why is Matt Craighead so smart?
 * A) He has two brains.

/**
 * UNRESOLVED ISSUES:
 *
 * 1. Should we have NvRmFill* APIs in addition to NvRmWrite*?  Say, if you just
 *    want to clear a buffer to zero?
 *
 * 2. There is currently an issue with a memhandle that is shared across
 *    processes.  If a MemHandle is created, and then duplicated into another
 *    process using NvRmMemHandleGetId/NvRmMemHandleFromId it's not clear
 *    what would happen if both processes tried to do an NvRmAlloc on a handle.
 *    Perhaps make NvRmMemHandleGetId fail if the memory is not already
 *    allocated.
 *
 * 3. It may be desirable to have more hMem query functions, for debuggability.
 *    Part of the information associated with a memory buffer will live in
 *    kernel space, and not be accesible efficiently from a user process.
 *    Knowing which heap a buffer is in, or whether a buffer is pinned or
 *    mapped could be useful.  Note that queries like this could involve race
 *    conditions.  For example, memory could be moved from one heap to another
 *    the moment after you ask what heap it's in.

 * @ingroup nvddk_rm
 *
 * The APIs in this header file are intended to be used for allocating and
 * managing memory that needs to be accessed by HW devices.  It is not intended
 * as a replacement for malloc() -- that functionality is provided by
 * NvOsAlloc().  If only the CPU will ever access the memory, this API is
 * probably extreme overkill for your needs.
 *
 * Memory allocated by NvRmMemAlloc() is intended to be asynchronously movable
 * by the RM at any time.  Although discouraged, it is possible to permanently
 * lock down ("pin") a memory buffer such that it can never be moved.  Normally,
 * however, the intent is that you would only pin a buffer for short periods of
 * time, on an as-needed basis.
 *
 * The first step to allocating memory is allocating a handle to refer to the
 * allocation.  The handle has a separate lifetime from the underlying buffer.
 * Some properties of the memory, such as its size in bytes, must be declared at
 * handle allocation time and can never be changed.
 *
 * After successfully allocating a handle, you can specify properties of the
 * memory buffer that are allowed to change over time.  (Currently no such
 * properties exist, but in the past a "priority" attribute existed and may
 * return some day in the future.)
 *
 * After specifying the properties of the memory buffer, it can be allocated.
 * Some additional properties, such as the set of heaps that the memory is
 * permitted to be allocated from, must be specified at allocation time and
 * cannot be changed over the buffer's lifetime of the buffer.
 *
 * The Coherency specified during the allocation of memory buffer is used for
 * accesses that occur from CPU.
 * If the coherency specified is Uncached, The accesses from CPU would never
 * get data into cache.
 * If the coherency is specified as WriteCombined, The accesses from CPU would
 * never get data into caches, But data can pass through store buffers.
 * If the coherency is specified as WriteBack, The accesses from CPU can pass
 * through store buffers and caches.
 * If the coherency is specified as InnerWriteBack, The accesses from CPU can
 * pass through store buffers and inner caches only.
 * On SOC's, where no outer cache exists, WriteBack and InnerWriteBack refer
 * to same coherency.
 * After accessing memory buffer from CPU, before handing over the buffer to
 * H/W engines, Cache maintenance(NvRmMemCacheMaint()) on buffer is necessary
 * irrespective of coherency used. Yes, even for uncached buffers, even though
 * cache is not flushed for Uncached buffers. It might be needed to execute
 * barriers and/or store buffer flushes depending how uncached memory is handled
 * in OS for the specific processor. It might be a NOP for a specific processor.
 * But not calling, NvRmMemCacheMaint() can cause issues with
 * future processors that require carrying out any specific operations like
 * flushing pending transactions, forcing ordering, etc. to ensure coherency.
 *
 * Before accessing memory from CPU, after H/W engine writes memory,
 * Cache maintenance is necessary for WriteBack and InnerWriteBack coherency.
 * Speculative reads in a processor can get any data into cache for the memory
 * that is mapped as Cached even though S/W didn't access it explicitly.
 * In order ensure CPU access the correct data written by H/W module, it should
 * invalidate cache for the memory it is accessing after H/W has written to it.
 *
 * The contents of memory can be examined and modified using a variety of read
 * and write APIs, such as NvRmMemRead and NvRmMemWrite.  However, in some
 * cases, it is necessary for the driver or application to be able to directly
 * read or write the buffer using a pointer.  In this case, the NvRmMemMap API
 * can be used to obtain such a mapping into the current process's virtual
 * address space.  It is important to note that the map operation is not
 * guaranteed to succeed.  Drivers that use mappings are strongly encouraged
 * to support two code paths: one for when the mapping succeeds, and one for
 * when the mapping fails.  A memory buffer is allowed to be mapped multiple
 * times, and the mappings are permitted to be of subregions of the buffer if
 * desired.
 *
 * Before the memory buffer is used, it must be pinned.  While pinned, the
 * buffer will not be moved, and its physical address can be safely queried.  A
 * memory buffer can be pinned multiple times, and the pinning will be reference
 * counted.  Assuming a valid handle and a successful allocation, pinning can
 * never fail.
 *
 * After the memory buffer is done being used, it should be unpinned.  Unpinning
 * never fails.  Any unpinned memory is free to be moved to any location which
 * satisfies the current properties in the handle.  Drivers are strongly
 * encouraged to unpin memory when they reach a quiescent state.  It is not
 * unreasonable to have a goal that all memory buffers (with the possible
 * exception of memory being continuously scanned out by the display) be
 * unpinned when the system is idle.
 *
 * The memory buffer allocated as Uncached/WriteCombined can be mapped as
 * WriteBack/InnerWriteBack. Once it is mapped as WriteBack/InnerWriteBack,
 * entire memory buffer is converted to be WriteBack/InnerWriteBack buffer.
 * It is an irreversible operation. NvRmMemUnmap wouldn't restore the memory
 * back to Uncached/WriteCombined.
 * Beware of the fact that having conflicting mappings at the same time on
 * memory buffer can lead to undesired consequences based on the usage.
 * i.e, If the memory buffer allocated as UC/WC, mapped as UC/WC buffer,
 * and converted to WB/IWB, mapped as WB/IWB(without unmapping UC/WC mapping),
 * then care need to be taken to avoid coherency issues.
 * If UC/WC mapping(s) is unmapped before mapping as WB/IWB, then the memory
 * buffer would behave as if the buffer was allocated as WB/IWB at alloc time.
 *
 * The NvRmMemPin API is only one of the two ways to pin a buffer.  In the case
 * of modules that are programmed through command buffers submitted through
 * host, it is not the preferred way to pin a buffer.  The "RELOC" facility in
 * the stream API should be used instead if possible.  It is conceivable that in
 * the distant future, the NvRmMemPin API might be removed.  In such a world,
 * all graphics modules would be expected to use the RELOC API or a similar API,
 * and all IO modules would be expected to use zero-copy DMA directly from the
 * application buffer using NvOsPageLock.
 *
 * Some properties of a buffer can be changed at any point in its handle's
 * lifetime.  Properties that are changed while a memory buffer is pinned will
 * have no effect until the memory is unpinned.
 *
 * After you are done with a memory buffer, you must free its handle.  This
 * automatically unpins the memory (if necessary) and frees the storage (if any)
 * associated with it.

/**
 * Attempts to map a memory buffer into the process's virtual address space.
 *
 * It is recommended that mappings be short-lived as some systems have a limited
 * number of concurrent mappings that can be supported, or because virtual
 * address space may be scarce.
 *
 * It is legal to have multiple concurrent mappings of a single memory buffer.
 *
 * Pinning and mapping a memory buffer are completely orthogonal.  It is not
 * necessary to pin a buffer before mapping it.  Mapping a buffer does not imply
 * that it is pinned.
 *
 * There is no guarantee that the mapping will succeed.  For example, on some
 * operating systems, the OS's security mechanisms make it impossible for
 * untrusted applications to map certain types of memory.  A mapping might also
 * fail due to exhaustion of memory or virtual address space.  Therefore, you
 * must implement code paths that can handle mapping failures.  For example, if
 * the mapping fails, you may want to fall back to using NvRmMemRead() and
 * NvRmMemWrite().  Alternatively, you may want to consider avoiding the use of
 * this API altogether, unless there is a compelling reason why you need
 * mappings.
 *
 * Using Flags argument, memory buffer allocated as Uncached/WriteCombined can
 * be mapped as WriteBack/InnerWriteBack.
 * Once it is mapped as WriteBack/InnerWriteBack, entire memory buffer is
 * converted to be WriteBack/InnerWriteBack buffer. It is an irreversible
 * operation. NvRmMemUnmap operation wouldn't restore the memory back
 * to Uncached/WriteCombined. Ensure that no previous mappings exists,
 * when an Uncached/WriteCombined memory buffer is chosen to map as
 * WriteBack/InnerWriteBack.
 * If WriteBack/InnerWriteBack flags are not specified in Flags, the coherency
 * is same as alloc time specified coherency.
 *
 * @see NvRmMemUnmap()
 *
 * @param hMem A memory handle returned from NvRmMemHandleCreate/FromId.
 * @param Offset Byte offset within the memory buffer to start the map at.
 * @param Size Size in bytes of mapping requested.  Must be greater than 0.
 * @param Flags Special flags -- use NVOS_MEM_* (see nvos.h for details)
 * @param pVirtAddr If the mapping is successful, provides a virtual
 *     address through which the memory buffer can be accessed.
 *
 * @retval NvSuccess Indicates that the memory was successfully mapped.
 * @retval NvError_InsufficientMemory Out of memory.
 * @retval NvError_NotSupported Mapping not allowed (e.g., for GART heap)
 * @retval NvError_BadParameter Invalid argument(s).
 * @retval NvError_KernelDriverNotFound Can access nvmap driver.
 * @retval NvError_InvalidAddress Ioctl Failed.
