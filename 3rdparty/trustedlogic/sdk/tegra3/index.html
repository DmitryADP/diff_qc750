<h1 style="text-align: center">Trusted Foundations Tegra3 Android / Version AB01.16.37161 - Release</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Trusted Foundations provides a highly portable environment
for running security-sensitive code in a service-oriented fashion; client
applications executing in the Normal World make use of functionality provided by
security services executing in the Secure World.
These services are all exposed using the Trusted Foundations Client API (TF Client API), but this is hidden
underneath a more application programmer friendly API exposed by a stub library.</p>

<p>The Trusted Foundations includes a built-in Core Secure Service that provides standard security
functionalities, such as secure data storage, a cryptographic provider and a monotonic counter, but also
allows deployment of more complex custom services which could, for example,
implement the heart of a Digital Rights Management scheme.</p>

<p>This version of the Trusted Foundations is designed to run on Nvidia Tegra3 processors,
which is based on a Cortex-A9 processor.
This architecture provides isolation between Normal World and Secure World memory and
devices. Secure service code and data executing on top of the Trusted Foundations in the Secure
World is protected from malicious applications and rogue device drivers in the
Normal World OS.</p>

<p>The Trusted Foundations supports secure services developed via the TF SDK (Trusted Foundations Software Development Kit) and using the SSDI (Secure Service
Development Interface). These services developed using C and compiled to native machine code.

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Through the documentation within this release, different terms may be used for the same entity. Hereafter are the equivalent of
	some common terms that may be called differently.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Trusted Foundations (TF)</b> is the Trusted Logic product name.</li>
	        <li>The <b>Trusted Foundations Client API (TF Client API)</b> is an implementation of the <b>Global Platform' Trusted Eexecution Environment API (TEE API)</b>.</li>
		<li>The <b>Normal World APIs</b> are also called <b>External APIs</b>. They are the APIs implemented by the built-in secure service and that are directly accessible
			by the client applications residing in the Normal World: Cryptography, Secure Storage and Monotonic Counter. </li>
		<li>The <b>TF Cryptographic API</b>, exposed in the Normal World (and qualified as "External API" in this case) and also in the SSDI (for the Secure Services) is also called <b>PKCS#11 API</b> and <b>cryptoki</b>.</li>
		<li><b>SST</b> is the <b>Secure Storage</b> functionality of the Trusted Foundations. </li>
		<li><b>MTC</b> is the <b>Monotonic Counter</b> functionality of the Trusted Foundations. </li>
		<li>The <b>Core Secure Service</b> or <b>built-in service</b> is the secure service that is part of the core Trusted Foundations.
			It is used to expose the crypto, SST and MTC functionality in the Normal World. </li>
		<li><b>Secure Services</b> can be developed in C (they are called just <b>Secure Services</b> or <b>Native Services</b>). </li>
	</ul>
